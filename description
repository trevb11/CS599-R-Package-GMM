Package: gmmcs599
Title: This Package Runs a Gaussian Mixture Model

Authors@R: Trevor Silverstein, jbs438@nau.edu, 
Description: This package runs an GMM EM clustering algorithm using a model type "DIAGNOL" to fit clusters to data similar to the mclust::Mclust package.
              The package gmmcs599 contains the main Gaussian Mixture Model function GMM(), and two subroutine functions, e_step(), and m_step(), which
              update the probabilty of having a data point assigned to a cluster, and update the cluster paramters,
              respectively. The package also reutnrs the negative log liklihood and a classification matrix showing cluster assignments.
